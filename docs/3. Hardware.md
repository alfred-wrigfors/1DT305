## Power
The power section of the hardware is the most complicated section. There are three different sources (USB, battery and solar), all at different and varying voltages, that need to be seamlessly switched between while operating.

The battery is the main power source while in operation with the solar panel and USB acting as secondary sources to charge the battery.l
